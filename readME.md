# Code Challenge Week 2
This repository contains solutions to problems all written in JavaScript.

Author: Charles Kagoko

### Challenge 1:Changing the case of letters
This program prompts the user to input a letter or a sentence. The program then changes the case of the leters for example, "This Is Me" is changed to "tHIS iS mE"

### Challenge 2: Number Count
this program creates a function that accepts two numbers to generate an array of the numbers between them. For example, if the two numbers are 4 and 7, the output should be [4, 5, 6, 7] and -4 and 7 should return [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

### Challenge 3: Prime numbers
This is a program whose major task is writing a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array.
